# VELOS AI

**VELOS AI** is an open-source intelligent assistant built with Node.js. It leverages a Markov chain model trained on a curated Q&A dataset (stored in `qa.json`) and additional textual training data (stored in `text.txt`) to generate complex, context-aware responses. The assistant is designed to process full-length user input and generate detailed answers of up to 100 words without echoing the original question.

## Key Features

- **Open-Source and Extensible:**  
  VELOS AI is completely open-sourceâ€”feel free to contribute, modify, or extend its functionality.

- **Markov Chain Based Response Generation:**  
  Uses a Markov chain model built from a Q&A dataset and additional training data to predict and generate natural language responses.

- **Flexible Training Data:**  
  The repository includes a Q&A dataset in `qa.json` and a large corpus of extra training data in `text.txt`. Together, these files help the model generate richer, more meaningful responses.

- **Command-Line Interface:**  
  Interact with VELOS AI via an interactive CLI. Simply run the application and type your questions to receive detailed responses.

- **No Echoing of User Input:**  
  The assistant processes the full user question internally but only outputs the generated response, ensuring a clean and professional interaction.

## Files in the Repository

- **ai.js:**  
  The main application file. It loads the Q&A dataset from `qa.json` and the extra training data from `text.txt`, builds the Markov chain model, and generates responses.

- **qa.json:**  
  A JSON file containing a curated list of Q&A pairs. This dataset forms the core of the assistant's knowledge base.

- **text.txt:**  
  A text file containing additional training data. This file is used to enrich the language model, allowing VELOS AI to generate more complex and context-aware responses.

- **README.md:**  
  This file. It provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage details.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/epfklipteam/VELOS-AI.git

2. **Navigate to the Repository Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd velos-ai
   ```

3. **Ensure Node.js is Installed:**  
   [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) if you haven't already.

4. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   node ai.js
   ```

5. **Interact:**  
   Once the application starts, you will see a command-line prompt. Ask your questions, and VELOS AI will generate responses based on its training data.

## Future Enhancements

- **Improved Response Coherence:**  
  Ongoing improvements to the Markov chain model and training data will make VELOS AI's responses even more natural and contextually relevant.

- **Additional Data Sources:**  
  Contributions that expand the training datasets or introduce new topics are welcome.

- **Enhanced CLI Features:**  
  Future updates may include a more sophisticated user interface or even integration with web-based platforms.
